# Queue Management System
This is the project about Queue Management System (QMS), built in basic PHP, HTML, and CSS using XAMPP. This is the system that I made during start of my 2nd year.
To install copy the folder in the htdocs directory of XAMPP and make a database for saving and removing queues. The Database config is available in Config/db_connect.php change the values as per your database specifications and the project should work
